  [quote]
  ____
  In order to have an introduction chapter in my documentation
  As a bdd developer
  I want to be able to provide an asciidoc based document which introduces my software.
  ____
  ====
  Scenario: Introduction chapter in classpath
  NOTE: The introduction file must be named *intro-chapter.adoc* and can be in any package of your application,

  [TIP]
  ====
  By default Cukedoctor will look into application folders but you can make Cukedoctor look into external folder by setting the following system property:
  [source,java]
  ----
  System.setProperty("INTRO_CHAPTER_DIR","/home/some/external/folder");
  ----
  ====

	Given The following two features:
"""
Feature: Feature1

  Scenario: Scenario feature 1

    Given scenario step

Feature: Feature2

  Scenario: Scenario feature 2

    Given scenario step
"""


    And The following asciidoc document is on your application classpath
"""asciidoc
= *Introduction*

Cukedoctor is a *Living documentation* tool which integrates Cucumber and Asciidoctor in order to convert your _BDD_ tests results into an awesome documentation.

Here are some design principles:

* Living documentation should be readable and highlight your software features;
** Most bdd tools generate reports and not a truly documentation.
* Cukedoctor *do not* introduce a new API that you need to learn, instead it operates on top of http://www.relishapp.com/cucumber/cucumber/docs/formatters/json-output-formatter[cucumber json output^] files;
** In the 'worst case' to <<Enrich-features,enhance>> your documentation you will need to know a bit of http://asciidoctor.org/docs/what-is-asciidoc/[asciidoc markup^].
"""

    When Bdd tests results are converted into documentation by Cukedoctor



    Then Resulting documentation should have the provided introduction chapter
"""asciidoc

= *Documentation*
